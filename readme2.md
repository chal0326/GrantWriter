##UPDATED README.md

Flow for the app should be as follows:
-User inputs their draft into the Draft Editor.
-User clicks "Submit for Review" button.
-AI critiques the draft and provides feedback in a "section Analysis"
-User can select a box to submit the section to the AI for rewriting or "improvement" after reading the feedback.
-User clicks "Get Improvements" button
-AI will provide the user with 2 options as replacements for each one of the sections that the user selected. The User can select one of the two options or decide to keep the original if they are not happy with either option.
-Once all the sections that have received improvement have had either option selected or original retained, user clicks "Get Final Draft" Button.
-AI will recompose any pieces of the original draft that were not rewritten and provide user with a final draft that they can save in app or download locally. The user will also have the option to start the process over using this final draft or with a completely new document.
